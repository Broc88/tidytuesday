# tidytuesday

[R4DS](https://github.com/rfordatascience) provides each week a dataset and lets R datascientists wrap their mind around it to product amazing graphs.

My goal here is to perform some analysis from time to time and improve my skills(idealy each week but it will depend on sooooooo many factors that I can not be sure). It is also to try to use more tools from the tidyverse because for the time, my data wrangling strategies rely mostly on Rbase.
