# tidytuesday

[R4DS](https://github.com/rfordatascience) provides each week a dataset and lets R datascientists wrap their mind around it to product amazing graphs.

My goal here is to perform some analysis from time to time (idealy each week but it will depend on many factors) and improve my
skills.
